#ChiselTones

Chisel compatibility for ZTones blocks.

##Variation Modes

Currently, there are 2 modes to choose from when adding variations:

###Mode 0
Allow chiseling of the Ztones Tile into each of the different types Ztones adds at a meta of 0. Then you cycle through from there. This makes the crafting recipes useless.

###Mode 1
Allow chiseling between all the blocks within their type. This requires the user to still craft the type, but makes the cycling useless.
